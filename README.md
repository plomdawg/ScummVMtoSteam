# ScummVMtoSteam

Script for adding ScummVM games to Steam.

Many of the Humongous Entertainment games can be found on [archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Humongous+Entertainment%22). Only a few [datafiles](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Datafiles) are needed to run each game with ScummVM. This script creates Steam shortcuts for launching ScummVM.
